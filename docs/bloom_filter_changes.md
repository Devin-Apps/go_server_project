# Bloom Filter Changes

The Bloom filter implementation has been updated to support per-repository Bloom filters. Each repository now manages its own Bloom filter, allowing for more granular control and potential performance improvements. The Bloom filters are stored in the repositories collection and are updated whenever pull requests are processed. This change enhances the ability to track and manage pull requests efficiently across different repositories.

## Key Changes

- **Per-Repository Bloom Filters**: Each repository now has its own Bloom filter, which is initialized and updated independently. This allows for more precise tracking of pull requests specific to each repository.

- **Storage and Update**: The Bloom filters are stored in the `repositories` collection and are updated whenever new pull requests are processed. This ensures that the Bloom filter remains accurate and up-to-date.

- **Granularity and Performance**: By having individual Bloom filters for each repository, the system can achieve better granularity in tracking pull requests. This can lead to potential performance improvements, as the Bloom filter operations are more focused and efficient.

## Benefits

- **Improved Tracking**: The ability to manage Bloom filters on a per-repository basis allows for more accurate tracking of pull requests, reducing the likelihood of false positives.

- **Scalability**: As the number of repositories grows, the system can scale more effectively by managing Bloom filters independently for each repository.

- **Efficiency**: The focused nature of per-repository Bloom filters can lead to more efficient operations, as each filter only needs to handle data relevant to its specific repository.

## Conclusion

The updated Bloom filter implementation provides significant improvements in granularity, performance, and scalability. By managing Bloom filters on a per-repository basis, the system can more effectively track and manage pull requests, leading to a more efficient and scalable solution.
